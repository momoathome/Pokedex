# Pokedex

In This Project I used Vue.JS with Vite and the Pokemon API https://pokeapi.co/ to build a "Pokedex"

# How it works
On initialization the Api is called and getting us a, from us defined amount of Objects back
These Objects contain a individual link to the Pokemon details
We call the link in an async for loop to retrieve the Pokemon Details
Which are then ordered and displayed in a grid

# What you see
You see a Rectangle where The Background are the colors of the Element from the Pokemon
A Picture and the Name of the Pokemon

# Modal
If you click on a Pokemon you will see a Modal with detailed Information about the clicked Pokemon
